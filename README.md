# houdiniCustomHDA

A growing collection of custom Houdini Digital Assets (HDAs) for procedural workflows, simulation setups, and viewport utilities.

These tools are built to enhance production efficiency, give artists intuitive controls, and improve scene organization for both technical and creative users.

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Add the HDAs to your Houdini `otls/` folder or load manually in the scene

## 🧰 Usage

Each HDA comes with built-in parameter labels and tooltips. Most include:

- Support for both default and input-driven geometry
- UI-optimized interfaces (folders, toggles, previews)
- Handle bindings for direct manipulation in the viewport
- Procedural controls (e.g. noise, multipliers, falloffs)
